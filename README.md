# Helicopter Tracker

This project displays the real-time status of local news helicopters (and optionally police helicopters) using data from [adsb.lol](https://adsb.lol). The frontend is a live-updating table showing each helicopter’s station, tail number, and whether it is currently **flying**, **on the ground**, or **unknown**.
